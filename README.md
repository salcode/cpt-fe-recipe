# Iron Code Recipe Custom Post Type

This plugin powers the recipe section on https://ferrarello.com/recipes.

It also serves as a companion plugin to my blog post
[WordPress CPT Best Practices](https://salferrarello.com/cpt-best-practices/),
which was created as a companion post to my WordCamp Lehigh Valley 2016
presentation [Best Practices for Creating Custom Post Types](http://wordpress.tv/2016/08/31/sal-ferrarello-best-practices-for-creating-custom-post-types/).

This plugin can be found at https://github.com/salcode/cpt-fe-recipe
